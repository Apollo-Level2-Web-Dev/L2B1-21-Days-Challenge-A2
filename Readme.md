    - Add an additional Chart Sections (other than Pie Chart) to implement any other statistical data

## **Key Requirements:**

- Use theÂ `app`Â directory and its routing capabilities.
- Implement user authentication and authorization

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ You can use either NextAuth.JS / Firebase/ OAuth 2.0 or Custom Authentication system in the frontend.

</aside>

- Use Node.js Express for the backend.
- Use Figma design as a guide for UI elements and styling. You can also modify the designs on your own. But the designs should be standard.
- Implement a responsive layout using Tailwind CSS, ShadCn / Ant Design or any similar kind of CSS framework.

## Requirement Analysis:

1. **Backend Integration:**
    - Node.js Express
2. **Database:**
    - You can use **MongoDB / PostgreSQL as Database**. If you are interested, you can use **Mongoose  / Prisma / TypeORM / Sequelize** to create the schema for your database. Keep in mind that **using Mongoose  / Prisma / TypeORM / Sequelize is optional.**
    - **Custom Authentication & Authorization System** in **Backend** to persist the user information like user roles etc.
        
        <aside>
        ðŸ’¡ You can keep JWT token based authentication & authorization or simple authentication without JWT.
        
        </aside>
        
    - In Frontend, Handle User Authentication & Authorization with **Next Auth Credential Provider / Firebase / OAuth 2.0**
        
        <aside>
        ðŸ’¡ If you use Firebase / OAuth 2.0 or Next Auth, you must persist the user information in your database with custom backend.
        
        </aside>
        
    
     ****
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ You can use any data fetching libraries like **RTK Query / Tanstack Query / React SWR** or if you want you can use the **built in hook of React** to handle the data fetching and authentication / authorization in your frontend
